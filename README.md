# GSBS_GUI
A make-shift GUI for viewing results of the GSBS algorithm from 
pip install statesegmentation

Has horrible implementation, but is convenient.
I don't know what I'm doing and know have no idea how to build a proper GUI. No elegance here.

Can perform GSBS if a 2d numpy array of shape (ntimepoints,nchannels) given the parameters.
Can also display results of a GSBS object if saved after running.

If you have 

ToDo:
- [ ] Add save gsbs object button
- [ ] Expand input parameters
- [ ] Fix needing to adjsut kmax when loading saved results
- [ ] add more to do's
- [ ] Find someone who knows what they are doing for a proper version
