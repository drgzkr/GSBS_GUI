# GSBS_GUI
A make-shift GUI for viewing results of the GSBS algorithm from 
pip install statesegmentation

Has horrible implementation, but is convenient.
I don't know what I'm doing and know have no idea how to build a proper GUI. No elegance here.

Can perform GSBS if a 2d numpy array of shape (ntimepoints,nchannels) given the parameters.
Can also display results of a GSBS object if saved after running.

ToDo:
- [ ] Implement save
- [ ] Expand parameter inputs
- [ ] add more to do's
